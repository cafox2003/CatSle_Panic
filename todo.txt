1. Export images to a size of 105 x 105
2. Add larger text such that it's readable at this size.
3. When adding in text for the numbers, make sure to rotate the image by 120 degrees each way (instead of 90). This will make the numbers be centered properly.
4. Have fun :) If you feel like taking any creative liberties, you should!
